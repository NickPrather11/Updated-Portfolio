        <p>
          As a Web Developer with a diverse background of experience, I look forward to applying that diverse experience
          to future tech-heavy positions in web and software development. I come from a highly musical background
          focusing on creation and recording of music as well as the workings of the technology used to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          I pride myself at being able to create an organized approach to problem-solving using multiple perspectives.
          Whether Iâ€™m simply sketching out an algorithm or building on my current understanding of HTML5, CSS (and
          various frameworks), Javascript, JQuery, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL, Express.js and React.js, I enjoy using the
          skills at my disposal to create a fluid and attractive finished product.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a quick learner and good at making complicated data and problems more digestible. I am also very
          passionate about the learning process and developing paths toward understanding. I believe that my skills at
          writing music and working with synthesizers and recording hardware would make me a good candidate for
          developing fluid and intuitive User Interfaces and processing the data created therein.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having graduated from the UNC Coding Bootcamp, I greatly look forward to continuous learning and I hope to
          provide my skills and enthusiasm for knowledge as an asset to whatever fields and positions I pursue.
